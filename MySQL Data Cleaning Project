-- 2. Standardize Data

SELECT DISTINCT industry

FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'Bally%';

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'airbnb%';

-- Airbnb is a travel but this one isn't populated
-- Write a query that if there is another row with the same company name, it will update it to the non-null industry values

-- Set the blanks to nulls 
UPDATE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
SET industry = NULL
WHERE industry = '';

-- Check those are all null

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- Populate those nulls if possible

UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2
ON t1.company = t2.company
SET t1.industry = t2.industry
WHERE t1.industry IS NULL
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;

-- Bally's is the only one without a populated row 
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- Crypto has multiple different variations, need to standardize that

SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry IN ('Crypto Currency', 'CryptoCurrency');

SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- Some "United States" and some "United States." with a period at the end, need to standardize

SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country);

SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;


-- Fix the date columns

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');

-- Convert the data type properly

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;







-- 3. Look at Null Values

-- Null values in total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, and funds_raised_millions all look normal.








-- 4. Remove unnecessary columns and rows

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

-- Delete useless data

DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN row_num;


SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;
